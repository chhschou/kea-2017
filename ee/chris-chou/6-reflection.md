## What did I do well this week
I had a great week with a long weekend to start. Good focus, when I'm trying to, helps me get to reflect on the week early. The community lunch on Wed looks good and I will definitely join in next time. 
It will be really good for me to keep up being able to get to EDA by 8:45am, which requires me to be at my usual bus stop by 7:50am.

## What you could've done to improve 
Typing speed improvement is the top of my list. I have been trying to get use to the new typing pattern, but doing it through the typing lessons are very daunting because it displays my typing speed afterwards and can affect my confidence. Now I have a bit of time with the new patterns, the muscle memory is catching up and I feel a bit better to start typing lessons again.
